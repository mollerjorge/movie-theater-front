This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]

### How to run the project

1. Clone the project using `git clone https://github.com/mollerjorge/movie-theater-front.git`
2. cd into the project and run `yarn`
3. run `yarn start`

**NOTE: the .env file was uploaded with the token just for testing purposes, in a real-world project there should be an env.example file explaining which environment variables the projects expects**

## Conventions and best practices I used:

1. Eslint and prettier with ja11y and airbnb plugin
2. Typescript
3. SAAS and BEM for styling along with styled-components
4. React.memo, React.context API, lazy, Suspense and ErrorBoundary
5. axios for making requests with interceptors and parsers to convert snake case to camel case keys
5. react-intl for internationalization
6. styled-component theme to store global variables

## Things I would like to do to embellish code:

1. Unit tests with enzyme and jest ðŸ§ª
2. Better handling of errors when making server requests ðŸš©
3. Make the design responsive ðŸ“±
4. Storybook to make isolated component stories ðŸ“•
5. Follow gitflow properly ðŸŒ³
